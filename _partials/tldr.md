## TLDR

Add TLDR - a modern addition to MAN pages, which will help you find nice documentation and examples on most Linux commands:

```bash
cd ~
pip3 install -U pip
pip3 install tldr
```
❗️ It is one of the very few tools we will install from the default system python interpreter, because it has se few [dependencies](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/requirements.txt)

You can try `tldr` with:

```bash
tldr gh
```

ℹ️ It's normal that it takes ~1 minute the first time, as the cache needs to be built. Subsequent calls will be fast.

Finally you should get:
